1. The first value in the box represents the block number.

8. The current player is marked using the green text.

9. If the property is mortgaged and another player is currently on the property, the text turns yellow to represent red + green.

10. Inside the smaller box, you would see how the to each property, each property has a parenthesis right infront of it to represent the number of houses the property has.

11. If a property has 5 houses(5 in the parenthesis), then the property has an hotel.

12. The current position of all players can be seen right in front of the property name. For example, 1. GO>1>2, means player 1 and 2 are on location 1, A.K.A GO.

GENERAL RULES:
==============
13. Saving and exiting can only be done when the board is printed, when a player is still playing, you are unable to save or exit.

14. Every player starts with $1500 dollars.

15. Save can be done by pressing 'CTRL + S', and exiting can be done by pressing 'esc'.

16. As you would notice, the speed of the player movement animation(represented by making the current location green texted) may be too slow or too fast for some users. Therefore, to speed up the animation, be sure to attach a small number while executing this program. For example, running using './a.out 10' makes the animation extremely fast and running using './a.out 5000' makes the animation very slow. So it is recommended to pick a value between 100 - 3000, but again, it depends on YOU.
